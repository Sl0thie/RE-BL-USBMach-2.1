# RE-BL-USBMach-2.1

A WIP to attempt to reverse engineer the BL-USBMAach2.1 card. The aim was to repurpose the card for other uses besides controlling a CNC machine.

Currently the card can be activated and the major axes can be controlled one at a time in a "jogging" mode. I don't have a power source at the moment so can only use LED's on a wishboard to test.

The project also contains a console window used to help find which bytes are different or unexpected.
